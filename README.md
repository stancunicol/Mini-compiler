# Mini-compiler
# **Overview**

Mini-Compiler is a simple compiler developed in C++ that processes a custom programming language. It performs lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis and generates intermediate code. The project was built for educational purposes, demonstrating fundamental compiler construction techniques.


# **Features**

Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the input source code.

Syntactic Analysis: Parses the tokenized code using a grammar-based approach.

Semantic Analysis: Ensures the correctness of variable declarations, types, and expressions.

Intermediate Code Generation: Produces an intermediate representation of the code for further processing.
